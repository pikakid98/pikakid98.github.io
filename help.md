Downloads from GitHub don't start
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your internet might be slow and is taking a while to connect so just wait
```
```
Downloads are stuck at 0 Bytes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Either GitHub is having some issues or your internet is down. Though if you're viewing this page to
check the problem then it might just be GitHub. It's nothing I can help with. Sorry.
```
```
Google Chrome stopped the download and gives me an error
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Either your internet is having problems, Your (possible) VPN is down or GitHub is down. That's not my
problem
```
```
Google Chrome is warning me that the files are unsafe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of my files are 100% malware free and contain absolutely nothing malicious. You should be safe to
download it.
```
```
Google Chrome is blocking the files and saying that they are DANGEROUS!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the downloads listed on my website are completely safe and will NOTÂ harm your computer.
I can promise you that these are false positives. If you don't believe in false positives and
think I'm serving malware then I'm sorry but none of the files on this website are malicious.
```
```
A file I downloaded was picked up by my antivirus
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few of the games listed are made with Game Maker Studio and Game Maker 8.1 which some antivirus
engines detect as malware for some reason. Again.. I assure you that these files are NOT malware.
```
```
I can't find the downloads
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The downloads are linked under each individual page from the download button. If you still can't find
it then just click the repositories and manually type "/download" (without "") into your URL bar
```
```
I can't extract the files. ".7z" isn't a valid file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd recommend the download and use of 7-Zip from https://www.7-zip.org
```
```
I don't use Windows. How can I play the games/use the software without Windows?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd recommend the download and use of VMware with a Windows ISO. Otherwise, all of the games and
software on this site are Windows only
```
```
I'm A WinRar user. Can I still extract ".7z" files?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. You can still extract .7z files with WinRar. Though if an extraction problem occurs and it
doesn't extract everything or something then it's not my problem.
```
```
I can't play the games/use the software/view the content while they're zipped
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't understand why people try to do this.. Unzip them.. Easy solution
```
```
I can't download the files from the links
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's strange. It should work. It's possible that I accidentally put the wrong link on the repo page
```
```
Can I contribute code to your source code?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure you can. Just please don't try to sell it or claim it as your own. You MUST give accurate
credit. If you don't want to give credit then don't fork my code
```
```
I don't use Google Chrome. Can I still download your files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can the browser connect to the internet?. Then yes. I only used Google Chrome as an example but every
question that has "Google Chrome" in it will apply to every browser
```
```
Wait a minute? did you just delete all of the other downloads? I had those bookmarked -_-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't remove any files at all. They're all available at https://pikakid98.github.io/mirror
```
```
Can I port your code to [X]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Please do. But if you're interested in having your port shown off then contact me at
pikakid98studiosbusiness@gmail.com
and I'll link your port on the GitHub page
```
```
Someone stole your code and is distributing/selling it full of malware
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If that's the case then if you can report it then do just that. I have zero tolerance for
code thieves or malware distributors
```
```
Why do some files show "Source Code (Unavailable)"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That means I lost the source code and have only uploaded them for public download. I'll
try to keep the source code in the future though
```
